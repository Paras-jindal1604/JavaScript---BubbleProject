# 🎈 Bubble Generator Project

A fun and interactive JavaScript project where **colorful circles (bubbles)** appear with the message **"Hello/Hi"** whenever you click anywhere on the screen!
Built using **JavaScript Events** and **DOM Manipulation**.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped reinforce the following JavaScript concepts:

- 🔹 `click` events
- 🔹 DOM manipulation (`document.createElement`, `appendChild`, `style`)
- 🔹 Accessing mouse coordinates using `event.clientX` and `event.clientY`
- 🔹 Applying random colors and styles dynamically

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Every time you click anywhere on the screen, a `div` element (bubble) is created.
- It is styled as a circle with a random color.
- The word **"Hello/Hi/Hola"** is displayed inside the circle.
- The bubble appears exactly where you clicked using `event.clientX` and `event.clientY`.
